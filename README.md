# Location_based_Services
 This Project uses Bing Maps API to deliver location services

In this project, following three services are provided:
1. Getting user location
2. Getting any location searched by user
3. Getting directions between source and destination searched by user

For this Project, following libraries must be installed:
1. Selenium `pip install selenium` :
    This library is used for testing of web applications

2. Folium `pip install folium` :
    This library allows to generate interactive maps using python.

Bing Maps APIs is also required. This can be generated on official site of bing maps. You will have to create a free account and generate API. Generating API is also free.

Chromedriver should also be downloaded. It can be downloaded from it's official site for free.
Then keep Chromedriver.exe on an executable path. I have kept it in 'C:\\Users\\Username\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python39\\chromedriver.exe'.
